              <p>I came to Falls Church to work as an Au Pair, it's been a great opportunity to come to a different country and to practice a foreign language. 
                I would say that living in Falls Church is a bonus because is such a great city to live! First of all, we have everthing here, stores, malls, 
                restaurants, metro station, etc. But we're also close to Washington DC, so there's several others places to go, and so many museums to visit!<p>
